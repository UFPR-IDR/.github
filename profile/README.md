# UFPR - IDR
Project developed to automatically identify cattle based on the muzzle points.

## Code
In order to follow the conventions for Python code the codes under this organization will use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#introduction) as guide. So you must have basic knowledge about how it works before uploading your code.

In case you don't have enough time to read it, you can read ["The Best of the Best Practices"](https://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839).
